# Flatiron Support Troop

A webpage of emotional puppies - a mental wellness tool for Flatiron students and coders everywhere; coding is always an emotional rollercoaster. 
Users can select an emotion to receive an appropriate spotify playlist, breathing exercise and wellness activity to accompany their emotion as well as the local weather, encouraging the user to go outside (weather permitting).   

## Installation

Fork and clone the repository [pip](https://github.com/vautre/fist-project).
Run the json-server db.json in your terminal and then run npm run dev to open the app in a browser of your choice. 

```bash
json-server db.json
npm run dev 
```

## Usage

Click the puppy that best matches your emotional state to perform a little wellness check-in on your self (not a replacement for professional mental health treatment). Note: users must allow location services for local weather to display.
